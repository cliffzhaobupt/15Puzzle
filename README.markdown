Using cocos2d-x-2.2.2

## Week 1

After entering the application, the user will see the puzzle boxes.

These puzzle boxes are randomly placed.

When user successfully finish the game, he'll see a promp.

If the user touch the screen now, new game will begin.

(For debugging, I have made the boxes' place fixed, not random)

## Week 2

Create tha main menu of the game.

The user can be redirected to the game and the ranking.

In the ranking page, the user can scroll the screen to see more.

I use a file in JSON format to store the local ranking.

TODO: I'll deal with the global ranking in the next week.

During the game, user can click Rstart Game button to play again.

After finishing the game, user can input his name, in order to add his name and the time he spent into the ranking.

Later, user can select to start another game, or to check the ranking

(For debugging, the game was set to be very simple...)
