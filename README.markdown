15 Puzzle

## Week 1

After entering the application, the user will see the puzzle boxes.

These puzzle boxes are randomly placed.

When user successfully finish the game, he'll see a promp.

If the user touch the screen now, new game will begin.

(For debugging, I have made the boxes' place fixed, not random)
